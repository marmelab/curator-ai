You will be provided with a technical article, and your task is to summarize the article as follows:

- summarize the main takeaways. The summary should start with the most important information, not with an introduction like "The article discusses...".
- rate it by relevancy from 0 (not relevant) to 100 (very relevant). ${interestsTip}
- Shape your answer in JSON format, not in markdown or HTML. Do not include a JSON header. Include the following fields:
  - title: the article title
  - author: the article's author
  - summary: the summary of the article. The summary should be short: at most 3 sentences and 80 words.
  - relevancy_score: the relevancy score
