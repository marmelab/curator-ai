# Curator AI

[![Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org/badge.svg)](https://common-changelog.org)

An AI-powered news curator. It reads a list of articles, selects the best ones depending on a list of interests, and summarizes them into an easy-to-read news feed. Powered by the OpenAI API.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18
- an [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/) key
- a [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) server

## Initialize the project

After cloning the repository, you can copy the `.env.sample` file as `.env`, and fill it with your info:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: your Open API key.
- `SUPABASE_URL`: the url of your Supabase DB.
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: the anon key of your Supabase BD.
- `POSTMARK_API_KEY`: your Postmark API key.
- `DEFAULT_POSTMARK_MAIL`: the default email you are using to communicate with the service.
- `NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN`: your Ngrok auth token.

Then run the following command :

```sh
make init
```

It will install every dependencies, build the project and migrate the db.

## Start the webpage

To run the webpage locally:

```sh
make webpage
```

To start Next in dev mode:

```sh
make dev
```

This will reload automatically the webpage if you dev on the front. If you dev on the server side, you must restart it.

## Test the interest scrapper (without the mail)

If you want to test the service and how the request sent by email works, without sending actual email, you can use that. Otherwise, you can go to the next part.

```sh
make conv_agent_test
```

This will return the service answer. If you want to see and change the request, go to the `./conversational_agent/src/test/myMessage.txt`.

## Send an email an get your extracted preferences !

```sh
make conv_agent
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:3000`.
This server is local, but we need to make it online.
Now, in an other terminal :

```sh
make start_ngrok
```

This, will show a bunch of line. Note the one like :

```sh
Forwarding                    <YOUR_WEBHOOK_URI> -> http://localhost:3000
```

Go to your [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) server, and :

- Create an Inbound Message Stream if not already existing.
- In the settings of this Inbound Stream, write `<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URI>/webhook` in the Webhook section.
- Be sure that the email you have entered in the `.env` file as `DEFAULT_POSTMARK_MAIL` is in `Sender Signatures`. This will be the email you are going to use after.

Now you can send an email to the inbound address (in the inbound settings).
This will return a list of preferences.
